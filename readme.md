# Challenge Week Car website.

This is a prototype car selling website I made during "Challenge week" at University of Essex where we were meant to create a fully working website in a week.

A video of the fully working website can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xA0zOcXlLECZxUf7Ri9s5mC_qBadMypQ)
